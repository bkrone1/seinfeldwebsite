				<h2>The real nothing</h2>
				<p class="morty">Kramer: Here's to feeling good all the time. Jerry: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life. George:<span class="red"> That’s a lot of pressure.</span> ‘Make love to me.’ What am I, in the circus?, "Jackie Chiles: Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement!." George [about the doll]: Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years. George: I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen.</p>

				<h2>How about some more nothing?</h2>
				<p>Good one! George: Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. Elaine: Perhaps, there's more to Newman than meets the eye. Jerry: No. there's less. Jackie Chiles: You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn’t tell you to put the balm on. Why’d you put the balm on. Jerry: Men don't care what's on TV. They only care what else is on TV."</p>

				<h3>Don't even get me started on nothing</h3>
				<p class="frank">George: This experience has changed me. It’s made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded. Jerry: Really? George: Sure, why not? Jerry: So you think it's a non-vite? Elaine:<strong> It's an un-vitation!</strong> ; George: It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang, and you jump out first.</p>
